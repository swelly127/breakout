    you only need to override the following five methods:

        `initialize`: Called at the start of the game to initialize your
        program.  It is preferable to put start-up code here rather than
        in your constructor.

        `update`: Called every animation frame (60x a second). This is
        where you add any game animation code.

        `on_touch_down`: Called whenever the user presses the mouse or
        a finger (for a touch screen device).

        `on_touch_up`: Called whenever the user releases the mouse or
        a finger (for a touch screen device).  Every touch_down event
        has a corresponding touch_up event.

        `on_touch_move`: Called whenever the user moves the mouse or
        a finger while it is still help down.  touch_move events are
        optional for each press, while touch_down and touch_up are not.

    These are the only methods that you *must* implement.  In addition,
    you should add whatever fields and/or helper methods are necessary
    for your game.

    Except in very few instances you should never need to add properties
    to a `GameController`.  As the controller, it manages all of the
